The young man fidgeted in the cold metal chair, he didn't seem to know what to do with his hands.

He was scrawny, his scruffy black hair  and he barely came up to the Imperial Aquila's proudly displayed on the chests of the two officers wielding shotguns stood either side of the door to the interview room. The young mans green eyes moved around the room, he looked at the two giants by the door, their all black uniforms. The only other occupant of the room sat across the table opposite him, partially shrouded in darkness.

The clock on the wall, the sole decoration on the black walls, ticked, although it displayed no time.

"Am I in trouble, m'Lord?" said the young man, breaking the painful silence in the room.

The man sat opposite him didn't answer immediately. He closed a file he had been thumbing through, and lit a lo-stick. The man was big, not as big as the men by the door, but still big, and he was clearly in charge here. 

"That very much depends on what else you tell us" he said. His tone was flat and monotone, expressing no emotion or excitement, but the words seemed to hang in the young mans head after they'd been spoken, like an echo.

That made the young man fidget even more, and the rising panic behind his eyes would have been clear even to those not versed in the arts of spotting the subtlety of human behaviour such as the man who sat opposite him.

"Let's start with a name shall we?" said the man through a cloud of exhaled smoke.

"A name m'Lord?" said the young man.

"Yes a name. Let's start with your name, if you have one. What do they call you?" came the response.

"Karha, m'Lord"

"OK, Karha, I would like you to explain to me why you are here" said the man.

Karha stopped fidgeting as he processed what he had just been asked to do, now he just sat looked puzzled for a moment.

"Because I was brought here by the troopers m'Lord" he said.

The man sat opposite him blew out a cloud of smoke. But said nothing, any expression hidden in the shroud of darkness that covered his face.

Tick, tick, tick - the clock on the wall seemed to get louder in the silence.

"I mean, er, well that is to say, I reported something and then they brought me here m'Lord"

"What did you report?" came the monotone voice.

"M'Lord, I found a- a man, in the- the walls m'Lord"

"You found a man, in the walls?"

"Yes m'Lord" 

"Please elaborate"

"Sorry, m'Lord?"

The man exhaled another breath of lo-stick smoke.

"Please tell me more about 'the man in the walls', Karha"

"Oh, yes m'Lord, of course" said Karha, the fidgeting was back, but the sheer panic in his eyes had begun to fade slightly, only to be replaced with a fear of upsetting the man who sat opposite him.

"So I came in from temple this mornin, m'Lord, and the landlady she usually hangs all the washing out on the walkways but she went and put it all up the stairs. She was so mad when I tried to tip-toe cross it m'Lord" Karha chuckled slightly at that particular memory but from the silence that echoed back from the opposite side of the table he sensed the joke was lost on the man "so anyways m'Lord I had to go round back of the habs and use the old entrance. The door sticks y'see m'Lord, need to kick it to get it open, and I guess I grew up a bit since I last went that way an I hit it a bit too hard. The door made a hole in the wall, I was about to run off before the landlady came, but then I saw him in there m'Lord."

"Him?"

"Yes m'Lord, I don't know who he was but he was a him"

The man stubbed out the lo-stick and lit another, Karha tried to see the mans face through the dim light of the firelighter. All he made out was a thick beard and a bald head.

"Please continue, Karha, what else can you tell me about this man?"

"m'Lord, he looked like he might have had some money, from what I could see from his clothes, but he was stuffed in there pretty good m'Lord, bent up in all kinds of ways"

"When you say 'bent up', Karha, what exactly do you mean?"

"He was all bent and snapped m'Lord, he must have done something bad to make someone do that do him", Karha said, his curious mind fishing for some sort of clarification of his supposition. When no response came, he continued. "er, that is to say m'Lord, that the wall he was in was not big it was about like, this size".

Karha made a gesture with both hands as if to estimate the rough side of the wall cavity in which the body had been found concealed in. Roughly the size of a mans head, the man noted, taking another draw on the freshly lit lo-stick.

"Did you see anyone around, Karha? Anyone hanging around the habs lately that might know more about why this man showed up in the walls?"

"No m'Lord, not anyone that I saw, not lately, specially not since the troubles started, everyone keeps themselves to themselves these days m'Lord"

"Indeed" said the man in shadow.

"Thank you, Karha, I think that will be all for the moment. You will remain here with us for the time being to answer any more questions we might have.

"Sergeant" he said without turning "please escort the young man to a one of our more comfortable holding cells and see that he is given something to eat"

"By your will My Lord" came the reply.

The two men burly men forward and Karha stood to follow them, but hesitated.

"m'Lord, may I ask a question?" said Karha.

"You may" said a voice from the shadow.

"m'Lord, forgive me, but what will happen to the person what put the man in the wall?"

The man leaned forwards into the light, his thick black beard was well trimmed but covered much of his face and his bald head shone from the glare off the single light above the table. He looked tough, that's what Karha thought, old and tough, and he had a big scar on his cheek.

"They will be punished, as are all who are found guilty"
