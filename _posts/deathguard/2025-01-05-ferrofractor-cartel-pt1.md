At some point last year (2024) I bought a Myphitic Blight-hauler.

![Myphitic Blight Hauler](https://www.warhammer.com/app/resources/catalog/product/920x950/99120102080_ETBDeathGuardBlighthauler01.jpg?fm=webp&w=920&h=948)

I don't even remember buying it, or who I bought it from, it showed up at my work in an unmarked brown package and I proceeded to leave it in my desk drawer for about 6 weeks.

It seems that the power of Papa Nurgle is powerful though. I eventually brought it home, and got it built up, and it sat on my desk watching over me for a few weeks. Little did I know that it was slowly infecting me.

To cut a long and tedious story short, I eventually picked up a whole deathguard army to compliment my new little buddy because he looked a bit lonely.
