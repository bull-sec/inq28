Nestled within the Hazeroth Abyss in the Calixis Sector lies the Agri-world of Hilarion. 

It is home to approximately 750,000,000 Imperial Citizens and 

Ruled by the Council of Seven Colours, Hilarion is a relatively poor world even by Imperial standards and is not well known outside of the Hazeroth Abyss.

Magos Biologus Miena Kohh.

Magos on a field trip finds some archeo-tech.

They begin excavation of the site.

A report is sent to the local offices to confirm a finding.

Criminal elements intercept the report and send mercenaries to secure the finding. (they bypass the trade-quarantine zone implying significant resources)

The Magos and their team are murdered by the mercenaries.

Miena Kohh might have spent most of her life in academia but she knew hired muscle when she saw it.

The leader of the group, a burly bearded man wearing black carapace armor swaggered towards Miena and her staff.

"Who's in charge here?" he said.

"That would be me" said Miena, putting aside her excavation tools and brushing the dust off her robe.

"So that would make you..." the bearded man paused to query a dataslate attached to his wrist "Magos Biologus Miena Kohh?"

"Yes, that's correct" replied Miena, "is there some sort of a problem?"

The bearded man didn't reply, he made a few short sharp hand gestures and his men began to fan out around the dig site.
