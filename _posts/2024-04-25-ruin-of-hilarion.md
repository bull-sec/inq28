Nestled within the Hazeroth Abyss in the Calixis Sector lies the Agri-world of Hilarion. 

It is home to approximately 750,000,000 Imperial Citizens and 

Ruled by the Council of Seven Colours, Hilarion is a relatively poor world even by Imperial standards and is not well known outside of the Hazeroth Abyss.
