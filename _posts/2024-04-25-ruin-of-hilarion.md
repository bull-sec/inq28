Nestled within the Hazeroth Abyss in the Calixis Sector lies the Agri-world of Hilarion. 

It is home to approximately 750,000,000 Imperial Citizens. 

Ruled by the Council of Seven Colours, Hilarion is a relatively poor world even by Imperial standards and is not well known outside of the Hazeroth Abyss.

Access to the planet is strictly controlled by the PDF and Imperial Navy.

Magos Biologus Miena Kohh.

Magos on a sanctioned dig finds some ancient archeo-tech (Necron in origin although they have no idea that it's Necron, as far as they know it's just an ancient race) - this was a tomb world, but there was an accident and none of the Necron on this planet will ever awaken, but nobody knows this.

They begin excavation of the site.

A report is sent to the local offices to confirm a finding.

Criminal elements intercept the report and send mercenaries to secure the finding. (they bypass the trade-quarantine zone implying significant resources)

The Magos and their team are murdered by the mercenaries.

The mercenaries steal the artifact and return it to their patron.

Turns out, that the artifact is a weapon of devastating power.

The patron plans to use it.

End of Part 1.

Part 2 is where our Inquisitor enters the picture.

Part 3 is where the Inquisitor kills the mercenaries patron... except they don't because a Deathmark pops out of an oubliette and kills them, and then the Inquisitor has to try and make sense of what is going on (and that leads into the rest of the world building)

Miena Kohh was a handsome woman in her late 120's, although the extensive but subtle juvenant treatments gave her the physical appearance of a woman of around 40 standard years. She loved her work, and she had over the years built up her team of adjutants, each member brought their own specialist knowledge and skills to the team. This was the first time she'd been to Hilarion, and frankly she couldn't wait to leave.

"What a backwards little world this is" she thought to herself as she carefully brushed dust off the latest finding from the dig site. The site, known as B7-4X-Epsilon to the administration, was referred to by the locals simply as "The Rough", due to the craggy terrain that made it difficult to traverse in vehicles. Were it not for the dig site Miena would never have any reason to visit a place like this. Hilarion was an Agri world, home to around 750,000,000 Imperial Citizens, though most of them were ignorant of that particular fact.

And what a dig it was. This was going to be the one that put her in the history books, an ancient race previously unknown to the Imperium had left it's mark on this world, and her team had extracted a number of items from within what appeared to be a vault made from a polished black stone. The site had been discovered by a local worker who had been hiding from his duties, the worker had of course been disciplined for neglecting their work, Miena didn't like to think what that punishment might have been.

The prize of the dig so far had been a long casket, made from the same polished black stone as the walls of the vault. Measuring around 2 metres it Strange sigils and images were carved into the black stone in astonishing detail and clarity, whomever had made this was a craftsman of the most precise nature. From the initial auspex readings the measurements of the casket were, well precise didn't quite manage to convey the quality of the work.

"Mistress, there are some men approaching" said Thesias, one of her adjutants stirring her from her thoughts.

Miena Kohh might have spent most of her life in academia but she knew danger when she saw it and these men were very clearly dangerous.

The leader of the group, a burly bearded man wearing black carapace armour swaggered towards Miena and her adjutants with the confidence of a man who knows his own worth in a combat situation. Following him was a group of at least 15 men, brutes to a man, most with short cropped or shaved heads of hair, all carrying weapons.

"Who's in charge here?" said the bearded man in a voice that sound like it was being filtered through gravel.

"That would be me" said Miena, putting aside her excavation tools and brushing the dust off her robe as she rose to greet the newcomers.

"So that would make you..." the bearded man paused to query a dataslate attached to his wrist "... Magos Biologus Miena Kohh?"

"Yes, that's correct" replied Miena, "is there some sort of a problem?"

The bearded man didn't reply, he made a few short sharp hand gestures and his men began to fan out around the dig site.

Miena was not used to being ignored. 

"Excuse me, but who are you people and what are you doing here?" demanded Miena, taking a step towards the bearded man.

"How many of you are working this site, Mistress Kohh?" replied the bearded man, ignoring the question.

"Including myself, there are eight of us, plus 3 servitors" replied Miena.

The bearded man nodded, again consulting the dataslate on his wrist, the information Miena had just provided seemed to confirm whatever he was reading.

"Mistress, do you know if there are any additional personnel on the site other than those in your party?" said the bearded man.

"No, this is a sanctioned excavation, only myself and my adjutants are permitted to be here, is there some sort of trouble?" replied Miena.

The bearded man again ignored her question and said something into a vox attached to his carapace armour.

"I asked if there was a problem, sir?" said Miena, struggling to keep the panic out of her voice.

"No problem, Mistress, that all checks out" said the bearded man.

"Oh good, then would you kindly explain what it is you are doing here?" said Miena, feeling a surge of confidence.

The bearded man didn't respond, 

"Primus, we've accounted for all personnel" said a stocky man with a shaved head.

The bearded man, Primus, nodded.

"Man of few words this one" thought Miena.

"Excuse me, Primus, is it?" said Miena.

"I demand to know what you and your men are doing here. This is a sanctioned archaeological dig, I have authorization from the Governor himself" she said, reaching into a pocket to retrieve the dataslate containing the letter of Marque.

The stocky man stood with Primus brought his weapon up, some sort of autocannon from what Miena could tell, she wasn't a military type

"Slowly please, Mistress"

Miena felt her heart begin to race, who were these men, and why were they pointing weapons at her? She slowly removed the dataslate from her robes and presented it to Primus.

"As you can see, it's all been signed off by the local magistrate on behalf of the Governor" gesturing to the dataslate.

Primus nodded.

"Indeed it has, Mistress"

The first shot made Mienas heart skip a beat. It was so loud.

She saw the body of Selethica, one of the newest members of her team fall limply to the floor, a large portion of the back of her head turned into a fine mist by a shot from one of the autocannons borne by Primus and his men.

That first shot was quickly followed by a second, and a third, and a fourth... each shot accompanied by another of her team falling to the floor with various parts of their head missing.

Miena struggled in Primus' grip but he was far stronger than her, and her efforts were all but futile.

She watched as one of Primus' men methodically walked along the line of her adjutants, placing a single shot into the head of each one before moving to the next. Most of the adjutants were in a complete state of shock, some had defecated themselves, some were crying, all but Thesias, where was Thesias?

Thesias had been one of her favourites, he'd only recently joined but he was strong minded, highly intelligent, brimming with wit, and quite the handsome young man with his thick dark hair and wide shoulders, and quite the lover. He had been the one to alert her to the approaching men, and she didn't remember seeing him after that. Where had he gone? Had they taken him somewhere?

"That's some good work, lad" said Primus pulling a credit chit from his pocket.

Thesias took the proffered credit chit.

"Thank you Primus, I do what is needed"

"There'll be plenty more work for lads with your brains if you're up to it"

"Of course Primus, I do what is needed"

Primus didn't like Thesias, he was a devious little thing, when news of the finding at the dig site had been intercepted Thesias had been given the task of embedding himself within Miena Kohh's survey team and assessing any additional items of value, and ultimately guiding the kill-team in. The boy had serious brains, but a ruthless streak that belied his good looks and soft brown eyes, a dangerous combination, thought Primus.

"Was mistress Kohh suspicious at all?"

"No" replied Thesias.

"Mistress Kohh was more concerned with my physical attributes than anything else"

Primus didn't like that answer at all, it was one thing embedding within the survey team, but another thing to become Kohh's lover. The levels of deception made his skin crawl. He might have been a mercenary, and he often took money from people who he loathed, but he had always prided himself on being a soldier, paid to do a job, in and out, no emotions no questions. Thesias had crossed a line, but the patron was happy, and Primus wasn't the one who would have to live with the deception.

"That's good I suppose, at least we didn't get any trouble of any of the adjutants"

"That'll be all for now, lad, go see Soren and pick up your gear"

Thesias nodded. "Primus", then left the little office that Primus used without closing the door.
