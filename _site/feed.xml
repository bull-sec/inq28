<p>I don’t even remember buying it, or who I bought it from, it showed up at my work in an unmarked brown package and I proceeded to leave it in my desk drawer for about 6 weeks.</p>

<p>It seems that the power of Papa Nurgle is powerful though. I eventually brought it home, and got it built up, and it sat on my desk watching over me for a few weeks. Little did I know that it was slowly infecting me.</p>

<p>To cut a long and tedious story short, I eventually picked up a whole deathguard army to compliment my new little buddy because he looked a bit lonely.</p>

Good question... I'm not exactly sure yet. Mostly miniatures, and the painting and assembly thereof, as well as adjacent things like making terrain.

Mostly it's the results of me wanting to make my own blogging template because I couldn't find one that I liked that I didn't have to pay for. I'm by no means a developer, but I have a somewhat adjacent skill set so I managed to cobble together a Jekyll template and steal some code from people who are way better at that sort of thing that I am and hey-presto.

You can reach out to me on BSky and Instagram @PaintsPlastic if that's something that you feel like you want to do.

Anyway, welcome, and I hope you find something here that inspires you or you just think is kinda neat.
