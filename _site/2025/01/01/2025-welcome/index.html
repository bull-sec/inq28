      <p>This is just a quick post to act as a first proper post, and as a short welcome and introduction to anyone that might have stumbled onto this little blog of mine and is wondering “What the heck is this?”</p>

<p>Good question… I’m not exactly sure yet. Mostly miniatures, and the painting and assembly thereof, as well as adjacent things like making terrain.</p>

<p>Mostly it’s the results of me wanting to make my own blogging template because I couldn’t find one that I liked that I didn’t have to pay for. I’m by no means a developer, but I have a somewhat adjacent skill set so I managed to cobble together a Jekyll template and steal some code from people who are way better at that sort of thing that I am and hey-presto.</p>

<p>You can reach out to me on BSky and Instagram @PaintsPlastic if that’s something that you feel like you want to do.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome, and I hope you find something here that inspires you or you just think is kinda neat.</p>
