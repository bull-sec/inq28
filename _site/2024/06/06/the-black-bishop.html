<p>God Emperors Blessings on you, My Lord, I hope that this message finds you in good health.</p>

<p>It is with much humility and with The Will of the God Emperor guiding my hand, that I am pleased to report the utter destruction of the cult known as “The Crippled Hand”, a devious collective comprised of no individuals of significant note aside from their leader, an individual particularly well versed in Warp craft and the summoning of Daemons. I personally led the team and witnessed the summary execution of all known members of the cult after all information was extracted from the individuals that my team spared for that purpose. It seems that they were intent on bringing about a lesser warp being via ritual sacrifice, the full details of the purgation of this sect can be found in my full report which you will find attached to this missive. My continuing investigations into cult activity on the planet designated 3458-Decima has turned up an anomaly that I thought worthy of bringing to your attention.</p>

<p>During visits to speak to various informers and knowledgeable individuals in search of futher cult activity I had begun to hear rumours of an individual perpetrating the most heinous of crimes. The identity of the individual is unknown to me, but it seems the local traders and citizens refer to an individual called “The Black Bishop”. As best I can determine the name is derived from the reported mannerisms of the individual as well as their clothing, which are both described from various sources as “That of a Holy Man”.</p>

<p>This individual seemingly haunts the ruins of the industrial areas of 3458-Decima, the area known locally as “the blocks”. They do not seem to have any preferential targets, as the bodies that appear strung to the piping and walkways hail from many backgrounds and as yet I have not been able to determine any link between the victims aside from the typically horrific ultimate fate, and the presence of a particular brand they each bore somewhere about their person. The places in which the brand has been found vary with the levels of flesh still remaining on each victim. Of the bodies that I have seen with my own eyes, if you told me that they had been mauled by some ancient beast of legend, aside from the ridiculousness of the idea it would not cause me to doubt your sanity. I will not regale Your Lordship with descriptions of the states in which some of the victims have been found in, save to say that a certain xenos race would potentially baulk at the sights I have borne witness to while investigating this “Black Bishop”.</p>

<p>But the brand, My Lord, the brand is what drew my attention to this case initially as there is nothing obviously ritualistic about the killings, other than the gruesome manner in which they are despatched and ultimately displayed. But to mark each victim in such a way smacks of dark dealings.</p>

<p>The brand is burned into the flesh of each victim by unknown means. The brand itself has something of the Warp about it, I’ve not seen anything quite like it before and cannot link it to any known cult or practice. An pict image is included along with this missive for your records and the hope that the greater resources available to Your Lordship will be able to identify it.</p>

<p>It must be stressed that there are no reports of “attacks”, My Lord. There are only reports of killings. It seems that anyone that encounters this individual does not survive to tell their tale.</p>

<p>With Your Lordships blessing I will continue my investigation into this individual in an attempt to uncover their true identity and any links they may have to further cult elements on 3458-Decima.</p>

<p>The Emperor Protects.</p>

<p>Your faithful servant,
Inquisitor Jorge</p>
