<p>This is a test document for a conversion of OPR: Firefight into Inquisitor.</p>

<p>D6’s for rolling.</p>

<p>D10’s for character building.</p>

<hr />

<p>Idea: build a simple turn based system in which to base games of Inquisitor in. The rules need to be flexible, but have a solid framework.</p>

<p>Basing it off a combination of Inquisitor itself, and One Page Rules: Firefight.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Golden Rule: Have fun.</p>

<p>The Silver Rule: in the event of a lack of clarity or entire rule, common sense should prevail, see Golden Rule.</p>

<hr />

<p>The player picks one unit that hasn’t activated
yet, and it must take one action:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Move</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Hold</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Can shoot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Advance</td>
      <td>Mx1</td>
      <td>Can shoot after move</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rush</td>
      <td>Mx2</td>
      <td>Cam’t shoot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charge</td>
      <td>Mx2</td>
      <td>Moves into melee</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr />

<p>In the above example taken from OPR, we have a simple movement table for the “ACTIVATION” phase.</p>

<p>Instead of fixing limits, we can let the player use their models datasheet.</p>

<p>So for example if player A’s mini has a movement characteristic of 5, then they move 5 inches, but on a rush or charge they would move 5x2 or 10 inches.</p>

<hr />

<p>Calculating wounds.</p>

<p>A weapon does 4 damage and has a WS/BS of 4+, so it hits on a 4 or above.</p>

<p>The defender has 3 defense.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Physical Profile</li>
</ol>

<p>Movement (M): The speed at which the operative moves across the killzone, represented by a distance value.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Action Point Limit (APL): The number of action points an operative generates when it is activated, which are used to perform actions.
Group Activation (GA): Most operatives are activated individually, but some operatives must be activated in a group. This number states how many of these operatives are activated together.
Defence (Df): How many attacks the operative can defend each time another operative attacks it with a ranged weapon.
Save (Sv): How likely the operative is to avert an attack each time another operative attacks it with a ranged weapon, represented by the result required when rolling a D6. Note that a lower result is a better characteristic.
Wounds (W): How many wounds an operative can lose before it is incapacitated. This is explained here.

  <li>Ranged Weapons Profile</li>

<p>The ranged weapons the operative can be equipped with, and their characteristics and rules when shooting.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Name: The name of the weapon.
Attacks (A): The number of attack dice to roll when the operative attacks with this weapon.
Ballistic Skill (BS): How accurate the operative is when attacking with this weapon, represented by the result required when rolling a D6. Note that a lower result is a better characteristic.
Damage (Dmg): The amount of damage each attack dice can inflict. The first value is the Normal Damage characteristic. The second value is the Critical Damage characteristic.
Special Rules (SR): Any special rules that apply each time the operative attacks with this weapon. Common special rules are explained here. Special rules marked with a * are explained on the operative’s datacard.
Critical Hit Rules (!): Any additional effects the weapon can cause with critical hits.
